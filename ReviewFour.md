### Rating
I guve it a 6/10 because its rather short but has very fun mechanics that feel refreshing in the platforming genre.

## Summary
The game follows the niese of a man naimed fred, and her imaginary adventures through floating islands and caved using her uncles grapple technology that she found in his lab. Though it is pretty lighthearted, it ends fairly grimly with the nieces acceptance that her uncle is gone and that no amount of imaginary lands can fix that.
## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but it was very short compared to most games, though it made good use of its time to propel a good story. Very fun grapple mechanics.
