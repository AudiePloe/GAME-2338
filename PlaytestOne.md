**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ The rules were easly understandable, very straightforward, and explained thoroughly. 

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ Though a lot of the fauna didnt have a purpose mechanically, it did serve a visual role in the atmosphere of the biomes.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ During the begining the game is fairly balanced, but the further you get in the more unbalanced against the player it gets, such as a boss that gives you good armor but it feels like you need the armor to even kill it.

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ I feel like while it didnt get a lot of notice from the gaming community, it did come out in a good time by adapting the crafting survival genre to more of a hardcore and platformer appeal.

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ Yes, because the futuristic mechanics work withe the future themes, and the construction mechanics work with the ship wrecked theme.

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ I had a lot of fun playing this game singleplayer and with friends.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ The ground AI would frequently get stuck on blocks and structures but they also had the ability to "burrow" through structures so it wasnt too game breaking, this would usually occur when they are met with a tall ledge around three blocks high.
