## Rating
I rate this game a 7/10 because it was good but it was fairly simple

## Summary
Monument Valley is a isometric puzzle game where you solve puzzles by rotating the map and creating new paths through optical illusions. The game main selling point and feature is that the isometric view and level design incorperates isometric illusions much like the impossible cube, and that it is a solid puzzle game with good art. 
## Final Thoughts
I enjoied this game even though it was rather simple and didnt take much time to complete. I really enjoyed the art and illusions it incorperated, as well as the puzzle mechanics such as rotating parts of the level and using mechanical objects to change the design.

## Additional Information
There is a second one that I have not played yet. The art of some levels is amazing.
