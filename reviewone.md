## Rating
I rate this game a 9/10

## Summary
Though there isnt much direct story that is told, Hollow knight is about a city of bugs that has been taken over by an infection, driving the residents to become souless and wonder the ruins. The player wonders and fights his/her way through this kingdom, unlocking its secrets and new paths to explore. 
## Final Thoughts
I really enjoied this game even though it is hard for me to play single player games. There wasnt anything I can think of that I would change from it.
