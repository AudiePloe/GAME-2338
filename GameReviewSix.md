# Game Review for Broforce

## Details

### Game Title
Broforce: http://www.broforcegame.com/ 

### Rating
I give this game an 8/10 because it was a very clever and fun game, though a bit on the unfair side at times, and clunky.

## Summary
This game is about killing all the bad guys and saving the good ones, throughout the game you unlock new bros and save the world.
the mechanics of the game include shooting, jumping, climbing, and killing in many many ways. There is destruction of land and buildings, 
as well as boss fights that are very challenging at times. The game spans over various differet scenes, fighting various different people, and lots of destruction.

## Final Thoughts
I like the comedy and characters of the game because most of it is ripped from famous action movies and are made as jokes. The movement and climbing of the game feels a little clunky at times
but isnt bad to the point that I wouldnt play it.
