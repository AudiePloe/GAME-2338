# Game Review for Beat Saber

## Details

### Game Title
Beat Saber: http://beatsaber.com/

### Rating
I give this game a 6/10 (Vanilla) and a 9/10 (Modded)

## Summary
This game is a VR rythem based game where you use lightsabers to cut blocks in the prompted directions for points. I doesnt have a story. The player cuts these blocks and avoids obsticles in order to win, if they miss too many blocks or hit too many obsticles they lose. Each game lasts for the length of the song played.

## Final Thoughts
I like the game a lot but without mods for other music it isnt as good of an experience. The base game comes with around 16 or so songs but other than trying to beat a score they dont have much replayability, or enough reasonable challenge to keep playing some of them. Though with more added songs through mods the game is a masterpiece.
