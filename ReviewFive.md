# Game Review for Terraria

## Details

### Rating
I would rathe this game a 6/10 because it was fun but not really my type of game, the mechanics and ideas were really cool but I personally couldnt play very long.

## Summary
This game is about defeating various bosses in a corrupt world. The game follows a custom character that needs to survive and make friends with merchants, after defeating the wall of flesh the world becomes more corrupted with monsters and the player must defeat them as well.

## Final Thoughts
I really like the mechanics that went into this game and its weapons, because it hasnt really been done before as well as this game did it, the only downside to the game is that I personally just cant get behind it and stay entertained after a while.
